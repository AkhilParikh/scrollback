                    <h3>your privacy is very important to us. <br>
                        here's how we manage and use your data.</h3>
                    <p style="text-align:left">We take protecting your privacy seriously, and we want you to understand exactly how and why we use your information. This document is our Privacy Policy, which describes what information we collect and what it's used for. It applies to all interactions with Scrollback.in, including interactions with our site through buttons and widgets. It also applies to mobile applications produced by Scrollback. <br> <br>

                    Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of and/or registration with Scrollback will constitute your agreement to our policy. If you cannot agree to the terms and conditions set forth below, please do not use our services. Additionally, our Privacy Policy is part of our User Agreement, and by using Scrollback you agree to both.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:left"><strong style="text-align:left">About this Policy</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                    Scrollback is an open platform that allows you to communicate about anything you want on any topic you want. We collect some information in order for you to have an account you can use to participate on the site, and other information that is necessary to make the service work. Our goal in developing our privacy practices is to allow your participation to remain as anonymous as you choose and we don’t sell or profit from the information you share with us. <br><br>
                    We do take efforts to make sure the platform keeps working. This includes using your information, where necessary, to stop spam and gaming and other activities that violate the user agreement. We also share your information when we are legally required to do so. Please read this privacy policy carefully. It describes what information we collect, how it is used, and when it is shared so you can make smart decisions about how you use Scrollback! We think it strikes a good balance and respects you – our users – who make this whole thing possible. Let us know what you think.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="text-align:left">What Information We Collect</h4>
                    <p style="text-align:left">
                    <strong>Registration Information</strong><br>
                    When you create an account, you are required to provide a username. We also log, and retain indefinitely, the IP address from which the account is initially created. <br><br>
                    <strong>Messaging Data</strong><br>
                    Your messages are generally only viewable by the parties involved, but they may be accessed internally as needed for community support. Moreover, we keep a complete log of all messages sent on our service, even when both parties later delete their accounts.<br>
                    Scrollback stores the IP addresses associated with messages they are sent.<br><br>
                    <strong>Log Data</strong><br>
                    Log data is certain information that is automatically collected by our systems when you visit Scrollback, including the type of software used to access the site (browser, operating system), the address of the external or internal page that referred you, and your IP address. This information is recorded even if you are logged out of your account.<br><br>
                    <strong>Other Information Related to Your Account</strong>
                    As you interact with Scrollback as an accountholder, we save certain information about these interactions and your preferences: preferred language, all languages you see content in and date of last login. 
                </p>

                <h4 style="text-align:left">How We Use or Disclose Collected Information</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left">
                Our Use of Your Information Is Limited to Improving Your Experience.<br>
                It takes a lot of work to keep our site running and prevent abuse, and we sometimes use your data in order to facilitate this. Your information is used internally only where necessary to provide our services. For instance, we keep IP addresses in order to investigate issues with our site, track and block suspected spammers, and otherwise maintain the integrity of the community. <br><br>
                <strong>Your Private Information Is Never for Sale</strong><br>
                This means that we will only share your personal data with your consent, and after letting you know what information will be shared and with whom, unless it is otherwise permitted in this policy. While advertisers may target their ads to the topic of a given room or based on your IP address, we do not sell or otherwise give access to any information collected about our users to any third party.<br><br>
                <strong>Scrollback Will Not Disclose Your Information Unless Required by Law</strong><br>
                We may disclose – or preserve for future disclosure – your information if we believe, after due consideration, that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process. If we are going to release your information, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance via Scrollback's private messaging system unless we are prohibited by court order from doing so (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)).<br><br>
                <strong>Your Information May Be Disclosed By Us In An Emergency or to Keep our Services Running</strong><br>
                Other extraordinary circumstances may require disclosure: we may also disclose your information when we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person; to address fraud, security, or spam; or to protect our rights or property.
                </p>

                <h4 style="text-align:left">Cookie Policy</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left">
                Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by websites you visit in order to help them remember certain information about you. At Scrollback, we set only a few cookies for tracking user preferences, authentication, and collecting anonymous analytics data. Additionally, our advertising partners set cookies. Each of these uses is described in greater detail below.<br><br>
                <strong>Preference Cookies</strong><br>
                Scrollback.io will place a simple cookie to remember your room choices, which includes the rooms you choose to follow.<br><br>
                <strong>Authentication Cookies</strong><br>
                When you log into your account, Scrollback will place a cookie for the sole purpose of creating this session. It contains your user id and hashed authentication information.<br><br>
                <strong>Analytics Cookies</strong><br>
                We use a tool called Google Analytics to help us understand how users interact with our website. It tells us aggregate usage and traffic information, such as how the site was accessed, how long visitors stayed, and the number of first-time visitors to the site. By knowing how people use the site, we can make it better. To learn more about Google Analytics and how it uses your data, please visit http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.<br><br>
                <strong>Disabling cookies</strong><br>
                Most browsers include an option to clear existing cookies or reject new ones. However, if you do this, portions of the Scrollback website may not function as intended. <br><br>
                You may choose to delete your Scrollback account at any time. The usernames associated with deleted accounts remain unavailable for others to use, and your public profile is no longer visible to Scrollback users. However, the posts and content you made during your tenure as a Scrollback user will not be automatically deleted as part of the account removal process, though your username will be publicly disassociated with all posts.
                </p>
                <h4 style="text-align:left">Data Security</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left">
                Scrollback will make every effort to secure any private information submitted to us by our users. However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the service at your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as carefully maintaining the secrecy of your password).
                </p>
                <h4 style="text-align:left">Changes to This Policy</h4>
                <p style="text-align:left">We reserve the right to change this policy to meet the changing needs of Scrollback, or for any other reason. If we make changes, we will notify our users. Where the changes substantially alters your rights, notice will appear prominently on your front page. More minor changes may only be highlighted by the privacy policy link in the footer of our website.
