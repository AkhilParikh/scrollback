0c60fb4bab2b0704b230d8fc5da272ab 18330 linux-dev Arlie its a federal reserve european banker tax man judge landlord conspiracy !
2e82cccedea0d5aeafe591ec34d1e891 18337 linux-dev Azzie Lai: I am certainly willing to help and send you what little money I can, but I'm sure A paypal would help a lot more.

63c0ff508a597f42f5cce29c6cd05ee3 18386 linux-dev Arlie Lai, if you ever get a computer and an isp again, by all means, setup a website and start selling vitamins or something ... you have the skills to do it, you just keep thinking you dont need money

aa501092abaa66eac10399bfd039bd4a 18408 linux-dev Azzie Lai: You do need a bank account, but there shouldnt be any reason you couldnt have one?

74a5aa1d3fc2a8bb4a19a74a89afc842 18465 linux-dev Arlie if Q has bad credit, it will be hard to get a bank account

0e3f570c3fafbab74a7a199290347651 18494 linux-dev Azzie Not a simple checking account, you may have to offer them to keep your debit card though.
ba0638443e1c7041c15ad9a4039efa80 18498 linux-dev Lai i still think a $15 or $20 debit cards would be a better idear

293cbe861209fb67d0d9300f61846404 18796 linux-dev Nicki Lashawna: Here's a hint. Don't go around telling people you've been programming since 10. (yes, I know it's likely literally true. But it shows immaturity to claim it the same way professional programmers cite their years of experience.))
204a951ba54f7be79f2b93fd1c1f1c4e 18801 linux-dev Josephina Ricardo: and linux doesn't call it a com port, it's called a serial tty or something
10a24d3c421dddd45359d556183080c0 18806 linux-dev Mirta Lashawna - who are you and why does it matter so much? People who know me know that this is a step forward.

b823d8d68e940cd694aebc50a7b6a9ed 18843 linux-dev Arlie Lashawna, no, screw that, if your good, let everyone know it, except your co-workers
efbba48c742d7b769aa30b87afe9901e 18845 linux-dev Josephina Ricardo: and how to make a program think it's receiving data from it, would depend on how the program is receiving data from it
bcee4f7b67916e4b7a6bfa2bb5bf0635 18846 linux-dev Ricardo Josephina: ah thanks for the heads up
523e05ab75af0844826029c5b8846235 18847 linux-dev Felicia Lai: sure . can't hurt .. or open a temp new channel and let everyone interested join .. then take it from there
4de0b122e160727cacb8a588f8c19517 18865 linux-dev Ricardo Josephina: yeah, it's using some library to do it, guess I need to figure out how that library works
8188f64c451a35d658ee6d5a5e061548 18866 linux-dev Felicia Lai: open a channel called #Lai ;-)

8eb50382a21d7c579c9b562f2f520146 18922 linux-dev Felicia Lai: i figured to keep it a bit erm private
127547c84c880ff6d0d9f2c6fcbde845 18927 linux-dev Lashawna Arlie, that's interesting
fb9459f7ea8d991e3e6bb51e85c4a518 18928 linux-dev Nicki Arlie: cynic. :)
8e11478923d0990ddc011a7009f0c0f3 18931 linux-dev Arlie Nicki, at least, anywhere were there is a gap in skill levels

60f025afe59f7187741434fbaa4c82a1 18970 linux-dev Azzie Ricardo: Well, end of semester work, what could be better?
2fc2287ded977b3bf811e69f37693b36 18978 linux-dev Nicki Arlie: well, I've never been "screwed up" by a junior programmer. they come to me for help.
e61cbe874f7a0152e63caacd32597b6d 18980 linux-dev Josephina Ricardo: if it's just reading from /dev/ttyS0 or something you could somehow get it to just read from a named pipe instead
111b7794e52a22d2ae5591b258c4a8bc 18999 linux-dev Arlie Nicki, no no no ... someone below you is not a co-worker, they are an underling
917310c99b43da1bf2a3e0cea258f025 19003 linux-dev Lai Felicia: ok then what?
a7d4eb4477b846b5c8445bb9dc0f5683 19006 linux-dev Ricardo Azzie: I hate that crap... you in college?

ca6b4c713f097b1a4e6c47312c315176 19016 linux-dev Nicki Arlie: the sr programmers come to me for help, also. :)
ebdc7d00ddc91719e84e86b785374f67 19032 linux-dev Lashawna Nicki, then you should get promoted
372d69eae42fd77a122c67b942ef0139 19034 linux-dev Ricardo Josephina: hmm yeah maybe you're right... I might just have to end up modifying the entire program
ea8a68ceeb0e6f4d4c557c26f52681fa 19035 linux-dev Arlie Nicki, yes, but them comming to you, and you making them look bad, are 2 different issues
23fef7e00162f9e098e5e537826d35ab 19043 linux-dev Felicia Lai: post the info .. atleast it'll be logged soemwhere then .. i didn't know what/who's address you were going to throw out

35caedbf8d9acb3004cd19b05c7c2ba8 19163 linux-dev Ricardo Azzie: get on some open source projects like KDE or gaim or gcc or something
be3ba0acf3f7c0cb1e76a00dcc70e1ec 19164 linux-dev Felicia so what .. that's just one monkey Q
4784c0791508110722a1d29bd773046e 19165 linux-dev Azzie Ricardo: Either that, or transfer to a school where I can find a teacher who is as interested in independent coding projects as I am.
2616540618115e2afc7fab31b2c0feec 19184 linux-dev Felicia there's many more of us apes about
96efd603de9a076241cf98bf93a30e30 19189 linux-dev Dorthy the interesting CS classes don't start until your junior/senior year, especially if you're already familiar with the languages being taught and basic data structure concepts
7de99811c40688536876a0f058949201 19194 linux-dev Arlie Felicia, hey man, i was homeless and noone sent me any money
307b06042ca4e1ff33d8ff4c670206ab 19208 linux-dev Ricardo Dorthy: true.. I am going into my third year, finally get to do AI and OS and compilers, etc
8858e0a8864c723732b400a824e86aeb 19209 linux-dev Azzie Ricardo: I'm trying, but the problem is that I have to spend far too much time on schoolwork, even though im paying 30k/year for it.
e3a7fbd2c3d967d2cbfdaad0cdd586c5 19211 linux-dev Lai Arlie: did you ask?
049481fd50e1d01358b14f11611a1335 19215 linux-dev Arlie Lai, no
6c7c5296f0cb20fb62608d8a93ec01bf 19223 linux-dev Lai ok then
c19979a63d83c8ac6db3b4f4bc84433c 19232 linux-dev Dagny How can I discover which library file(s) contain an exported function name? I'm having a problem with linking against libpci.a and gzopen, and thinking another library may have declared the names
3b04da931ae0ef1736fbc5eaeb47ff23 19232 linux-dev Azzie classic
6831a7bb51e30ec9db8ddf56cb720e90 19234 linux-dev Arlie Lai, if you have a truck load of stuff, why dont you sell it
8f036892b860bbadadaae0df8521729f 19250 linux-dev Ricardo Azzie: hehe but it's only 3 more years... that's really short when you think abou tit.. I'd say just bear through it and get your degree, it's going to make it a lot easier to find a job and you'll get paid more
26685df724e2a91b17d7f80c4b0915f2 19251 linux-dev Lai i dont have access to my stuff atm
5602cd4a34f1f170e31359192bdac4ae 19254 linux-dev Arlie Lai, then when your out of stuff, find a south bound train and jump on it
c75788fc43e1d81757b807ec84802258 19260 linux-dev Alisa Azzie: hah, the CS professors at the local university are A.) A man with a degree in parsing, not teaching CS, and B.)A woman who is a MAJOR microserf.
4683e18602b3e3e6b35ae468440e3c9f 19260 linux-dev Nicki Dagny: strings and grep? ;)
5a47668c720065c186558eb604cebab0 19269 linux-dev Lai Arlie: yea or bus

fecb3765e6f14f9d72f191babffb8511 19290 linux-dev Dagny Is that it? With having ldconfig I thought there must be a location for the list of exported functions
00d48fdc2785f5dafbe6a9e875f273af 19307 linux-dev Ricardo Lai: why'd you get evicted? I missed the first half of this conversation
fc78eadee5aa35b72cd7ba2b10fb1532 19323 linux-dev Azzie Alisa: Luckilly at my school there are no microserfs :-). We all have to do our coding with gcc. The problem is most the profs just teach as a side job so they have their hands more than full.
8c4ff304bbaaf54c21b3f7c16756fdbe 19329 linux-dev Ricardo Josephina: lol I think it'd be much easier if I just modified the program....
