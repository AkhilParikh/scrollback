T1 7127 Jermaine: Meta, but $(date) is in large format
T1 7142 Meta: Jermaine, RTM
T1 7148 Meta: it tells you
T1 7157 Jetta: Santo: that requires running OS X
T2 7169 Malcolm: Rachel: If running as root, I need to set up a global config rather than ~/.fetchmailrc ?
T1 7173 Kathie: Jermaine:  date '+%m%d%Y'
T2 7183 Rachel: Malcolm: yup
T2 7190 Malcolm: Rachel: I run it in daemon mode under my uid and it works very nicely
T1 7192 Jermaine: I got it.. thanks
T2 7200 Rachel: pretty much put same info in global location.
T2 7215 Shanon: epic5 is pretty cool...
T2 7236 Malcolm: Rachel: OK thanks.. I'll try to find the docs on that.
T3 7238 Elma: hi folks
T3 7260 Elma: 'm sure i missed something but fonts rendering in my gimp works isn't at its best
T3 7287 Elma: is it because f the gimp or have i missed some tuning or such?
T4 7288 Sena: is there anyway to see what the CPU temperature is ?
T2 7296 Rachel: Malcolm: use "/etc/fetchmailrc"        -f <pathname> | --fetchmailrc <pathname>
T2 7297 Rachel:               Specify  a non-default name for the ~/.fetchmailrc run control file.
T2 7312 Malcolm: Rachel: in the man page http://fetchmail.berlios.de/fetchmail-man.html it doesn't mention any global fetchmailrc file... that is what was confusing me...
T5 7322 Thurman: hi, do you have any recommendations for saving videos from a webcam in GNU/Linux?
T2 7335 Rachel: Malcolm: give yourself a promotion - You decide! ;-)
T2 7341 Malcolm: Rachel: there are a couple of oblique refs to running as root and that's it.  And if I try to run it as root, it says "running as root is discouraged" and then exits :)
T5 7373 Meta: Thurman, try motion
T2 7379 Rachel: Malcolm: hmm
T6 7503 Thurman: Meta: isn't it strange that it writes to /var/lib/motion/snapshots
T7 7511 Malcolm: Rachel: ok my bad.. the /etc/init.d script exits automatically (and silently.. bitches) if no /etc/fetchmailrc exists
T7 7528 Malcolm: have these people never heard of error messages?
T7 7533 Jesse: Malcolm: it runs as user fetchmail here, and uses /etc/fetchmailrc
T7 7548 Malcolm: Jesse: thanks
T7 7561 Malcolm: Jesse: set up to do the same here, looks like
T8 7565 Rachel: well there ya go.
T7 7573 Rachel: Jesse++
T9 7638 Denny: so how does one enforce a permission set and ownership set on a folder and all its children?
T8 7655 Elma: poningru:  -R
T8 7660 Jetta: im starting to think it might actually not be possible to just put linux on an intel mac mini
T8 7687 Elma: poningru: -R for recursive...
T8 7756 Elma: well... have a nice day folks
T10 7783 Shenna: hi, are sata drives accessed as sda or hda?
T8 7796 Elma: sda
T11 7860 Johnathon: hey wat's up ?
T10 7885 Shenna: Elma: , then why is it that my 2.4 kernel recognises it as hda?
T8 7898 Denny: Elma, no I mean like always
T8 7904 Denny: so if anything is added to that folder
T8 7919 Denny: the permission and ownership stays the same
T8 7954 Denny: throughout
T12 7972 Latricia: is there a way to tail -f a file and have that output piped to sed to have certain lines colorized?
T13 8001 Malcolm: Rachel / Jesse: should i put the "set daemon" option in /etc/fetchmailrc ? I'm guessing not
T14 8020 Shenna: even dmesg says "hda:...."
T14 8025 Shenna: why is it so?
T8 8029 Elma: bye folks
T14 8029 Elma: Shenna: heu... not a damn clue, sorry... but why are using a 2.4 kernel?
T14 8055 Denny: Shenna, what are you trying to do?
T14 8060 Shenna: i am trying toswitch over ti 2.6
T15 8063 Melda: Elma: maybe because 2.6 still is getting root exploits as development goes on whereas 2.4 hasn't had any in a long time?
T16 8075 Tammi: hi, i am trying to dump a file system to a dat SCSI tapedrive. if i dump /var partition the speed is 1555KB/S, but if i dump the /home partition i barley get half that speed. Why would this be?
T15 8082 Denny: Melda, if you stick with around 2.6.12 its all cool
T14 8082 Shenna: but 2.6 gives errors on my laptop
T14 8102 Denny: Shenna, what errors?
T14 8119 Shenna: something like : kernel panic .. specify correct root=...
T8 8122 Lizeth: lol
T14 8124 Shenna: i am using lilo
T14 8127 Shenna: slackware
T14 8142 Shenna: on my pc it works fine
T14 8144 Denny: Shenna, right go to lilo and change root to sd whatever
T14 8153 Shenna: i tried that
T14 8154 Denny: while you are running
T14 8156 Denny: and?
T14 8157 Shenna: didn't work
T14 8167 Denny: same error?
T14 8170 Shenna: yes
T14 8187 Denny: waah...
T14 8192 Shenna: hey, how do i check if my drive is really sata?
T14 8202 Denny: open up your box?
T14 8202 Shenna: i am in windows right now
T14 8206 Denny: oh
T14 8211 Lizeth: does it have ide or sata cables
T14 8216 Shenna: linux not booting
T14 8224 Denny: open up your box dude
T14 8224 Shenna: it is a laptop
T14 8227 Denny: oh
T14 8228 Shenna: can't check
T14 8231 Shenna: just got it
T14 8234 Denny: Shenna, download a live cd
T14 8247 Lang: hm
T14 8248 Denny: not ubunut though
T14 8251 Lang: linux is cool
T14 8257 Lang: openmosix seems dope
T14 8260 Denny: Shenna, use knoppix
T14 8265 Shenna: i tried dmesg from slacware
T14 8273 Shenna: it says :  hda....
T14 8276 Shenna: etc
T14 8277 Denny: right
T14 8285 Denny: 2.4 you are not going to get it right
T14 8291 Shenna: k
T17 8302 Melda: Shenna: check the dev entries?  + some things change it... my laptop is definitely hda, my openbsd and 9/10 distributions recognize it that way - but for some reason my slackware sees it as being sda... just weird stuffs
T18 8303 Lizeth: 2.4 limited sata support?
T14 8324 Melda: Shenna: laptops are sort of odd in that way of sata/scsi/etc
T14 8325 Shenna: hey, any way to check it in windows
T14 8335 Lizeth: #windows
T14 8339 Shenna: Melda: : hmm..
T18 8343 Celestina vommits at the code quality he is currently witnessing
T18 8363 Santo: Rasterizing........... @ 600 DPI ^_^
T14 8366 Shenna: Lizeth: what is that?
T14 8385 Melda: Shenna: Administrative Tools -> Computer Management -> Device Manager -> Disk Drives right-click/properties/details
T18 8390 Santo: due the fiiirst thing i do once i get my website up
T18 8392 Santo: SHOWERR
T18 8393 Santo: ^_^
T18 8410 Denny: gaah
T18 8424 Lizeth: i have forgotten how to use windows
T14 8424 Melda: Shenna: what precisely are you trying to do though that it's having trouble finding out if its sda v hda?
T14 8434 Melda: Lizeth: isn't it such a pleasure?
T14 8449 Shenna: Melda: wait for a sec
T14 8463 Lizeth: i guess except when people ask windows question
T14 8464 Melda: wait for wha?
T18 8489 Margene: still a pleasure to me, to hell with dumb questions ;)
T19 8500 Lizeth: i have no idea why hes tarding around with 2.4
T18 8513 Margene: because it has no root exploits!
T18 8524 Margene: 2.6 is just waiting to get exploited!
T18 8526 Jeanice: he's on slackware, which i think is still on 2.4
T19 8534 Lizeth: so hes setting up a large scale secure network?
T19 8562 Lizeth: slack uses 2.4??
T14 8568 Shenna: yes
T18 8571 Margene: slack is crazy
T19 8579 Lizeth: glad i never messed with it
T14 8596 Shenna: hey it is a hitachi hts541612j9sa00
T19 8607 Lizeth: puppy debian ubuntu and elive is what i boot
T19 8688 Jeanice: just debian, here. i have about 130 gb of distro-less space but my connection is too slow to be downloading others
T18 8695 Melda: slackware has 2.6 available, just not default
T20 8711 Marion: What's the best way to create a Kiosk term using Linux?
T14 8712 Shenna: the internet says it is sata
T14 8819 Shenna: i have a acer aspire 5583
T14 8863 Rivka pounces around
T21 8876 Velma: anyone here uses LilyPond?
T14 8879 Melda: any newer aspire is definitely sata
T14 8884 Ashlee dissected a few recently
T22 8917 Jordon: whats the command to apply a patch? patch -p0 -0 filename ?
T14 8929 Shenna: http://www.hitachigst.com/portal/site/en/menuitem.dac393208bfae6f199558fe7eac4f0a0/
T14 8940 Shenna: check this
T14 8950 Shenna: these are the specs
T14 8967 Margene: I question that site!
T14 8976 Shenna: why?
T14 8983 Shenna: it is the hitachi site
T23 9033 Gale: <Lizeth> i have forgotten how to use windows <-- life is good
T14 9076 Shenna: hey, i will be compiling the kernel today, so any suggestions so that it will work
T23 9088 Gale: also, like they say -- time heals all wounds
T14 9092 Margene: yes, do it right
T14 9093 Shenna: i have 2.6.21 to compie
T14 9105 Shenna: *compile
T14 9115 Shenna: http://research.indocisc.com/~andika/acer/acer-aspire-5580.html
T14 9138 Shenna: i searched this thorough linux-laptop
T14 9150 Arlie: gah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
T14 9186 Shenna: Arlie: what happened?
T24 9200 Jetta: I would like to make linux bootable on my intel mac mini.  Can anyone help me out with some info on getting around all the EFI nonsense?
T14 9214 Gale: Shenna: yeah, I would go with 2.6.21 unless your distro is good about backporting security
T14 9215 Arlie: Shenna, another jerk wrote horrible code and unleashed it on the planet
T25 9245 Margene: that was me sorry
T14 9266 Shenna: Gale: what do ou mean?
T14 9347 Gale: Shenna: there's some security advisory up to version 2.6.20.8 afaik.  Guess what, if you use say 2.6.20.1, for instance, and your distro didn't address those vulnerabilities in their older version of the kernel, you're vulnerable.
T14 9377 Shenna: i downloaded the source today
T26 9383 Margene: the top distros usually do
T14 9390 Shenna: so i guess it is the correct one
T26 9394 Gale: Margene: indeed
T14 9403 Gale: but it's something to check out
T14 9414 Shenna: slackware is a top distro
T14 9418 Johnathon: linuxSUCKS
T14 9418 Shenna: k
T14 9423 Johnathon: F
T14 9423 Johnathon: GDF
T14 9424 Johnathon: GDH
T14 9424 Johnathon: FG
T14 9424 Johnathon: H
T14 9424 Johnathon: FH
T14 9426 Johnathon: FG
T14 9428 Johnathon: H
T14 9429 Lizeth: retard
T14 9430 Johnathon: GFGHFGHFGDHDGF
T14 9432 Johnathon: H
T14 9434 Johnathon: FH
T14 9436 Johnathon: FDH
T14 9444 Renate: lol
T14 9454 Lizeth: that was worth it
T14 9454 Gale: doot doot doot... another one bites the dust
T27 9483 Lizeth: what kind of laptop are you using?
T14 9488 Nicki: a norwegian windows user, :)
T28 9509 Arlie: this shitty code came from, of all people, one of the founders of AutoDesk
T28 9533 Gale: Arlie: is it a surprise?
T27 9556 Lizeth: dont they make autocad?
T28 9561 Arlie: Gale, its sad and disheartening
T27 9567 Gale: Lizeth: yeah
T28 9569 Arlie: Gale, i expect my government to lie to me
T27 9587 Lizeth: autocad is retarded
T28 9589 Arlie: Gale, but the OSS community rants endlessly about code quality that doesnt seem to exist
T27 9605 Lizeth: runs like its broken
T28 9607 Gale: Arlie: it's a mixed bag
T28 9629 Gale: Arlie: but the main thing is we can switch apps at the drop of a hat
T27 9630 Lizeth: havent used it in 8 years though lol
T28 9641 Gale: Arlie: so if something sucks... next
T28 9644 Arlie: Gale, sure ... find me another apcupsd package
T28 9649 Arlie: that runs on linux
T28 9673 Arlie: its not like there are 1,000's of them ... theres 1
T28 9708 Gale: maybe it's time for more then
T27 9755 Alisa: load ~/.darkstar/darkstar.irc
T27 9758 Alisa: whoops.
T27 9766 Alisa: At least it wasn't a war script :D
T27 9767 Melda: you know what they say about people who complain about a free product
T28 9773 Arlie: Gale, which is like saying, the current one sucks and is useless ;)
T28 9790 Arlie: Melda, im not complaining about a free product
T28 9794 Gale: I haven't used that particular one
T28 9805 Melda: Arlie: what? huh? i never said anything about you
T27 9822 Margene: backpeddalers
T28 9824 Arlie: Melda, im complaining about 1,000 assholes screaming "OSS HAS THE BEST CODE QUALITY" when it simply isnt true ... if you give something away, and it sucks, fine, say so, tell me it sucks ahead of time
T28 9840 Melda: i've yet to hear that ever... but ok
T28 9848 Gale: it's like anything else.  Has it's ups and downs
T27 9857 Margene: I say that all the time, maybe I should stop
T28 9890 Arlie: i just posted a message to the mailing list
T28 9904 Arlie: anyone wanna bet money on the fact that i get a "sorry, doesnt exist, use the souce" response ?
T28 9910 Arlie: i'll pay 2:1 if im wrong
T28 9917 Gale: Arlie: I think it's the zealous fanatics that make that bold of statements
T27 9922 Margene: I hope you used foul language
T28 9936 Arlie: Margene, nah, but i did have 2 or 3 typos
T27 10008 Margene: too many goofy acronyms
T29 10012 Jana: is there an easy way on linux to see the current size of the TCP half-open connections queue, and the TCP accept queue?  (redhat specifically, but I'd be happier with something that works on most linuxes, rather than something redhat-specific)
T30 10058 Maegan: I know it's not the leetest question in the word, but how do I remove those little bars that appear next to applets on the kde taskbar?
T31 10059 Nicki: have you poked around in /proc ?
T31 10077 Jana: Nicki: I've been looking in /proc for a while but havne't found it
T29 10093 Jana: also tried sysctl -a | grep net.ipv4.tcp
T30 10094 Margene: Maegan, lock taskbar
T29 10095 Jana: and netstat -s
T29 10100 Yuki: does anyone run an ipv4 tunnel through ipv6 ?
T29 10111 Jana: they might be hiding in one of those, but I haven't found either one yet
T29 10115 Yuki: i'm trying to create my own hostname for irc
T32 10130 Margarette: how can i do this: i want to protect some information, namely a PDF, i create pdfs with htmldoc, ive a webserver with php and mysql... i want a user to get the pdf and only be able to use it from the computer he got it in, how can i do that? i know its a very broad question but im not sure where else to ask... oh... and it has to run on linux, but the PDF will most likely be seen on windows but i dont know
T29 10190 Jana: Margarette: your question is vague, I can't quite tell what you're asking, but at first pass it looks like the answer is "you can't".
T30 10198 Margene: nothing should ever be seen on windows
T30 10215 Margene: except maybe a little devil gif flipping the bird
T30 10233 Margene: with ballmer's face pasted on it
T30 10273 German: Margene, don't wanna be a troll, but windows does have it's advantages
T33 10275 Paulita: youtube rocks :D
T30 10290 Margene: troll!!!!! ;)
T33 10291 Paulita: death to the people who want to prevent free speech :D
T33 10304 Renate: youtube sucks, lol
T33 10320 Paulita: arwen your a fool
T33 10329 Paulita: you want to pay for this?
T33 10337 Paulita: you suck wipe
T34 10337 Gale: German: and what's that?  Windows Genuine Advantage?
T33 10360 Nicki: death to all extremists! ... oops
T30 10362 Margene: well you have to admit, having an advantage is advantageous
T34 10364 Jeanice: Gale: i feel so advantaged by that, actually
T33 10372 Angla: youtube does suck. who wants 15 minute max hosting ?
T33 10382 Paulita: hosting?
T33 10384 Josef: they give more if you sign up as a director
T34 10387 German: Gale, for example ease of installing additional programs. Unless the program you're looking for is in the repository you have to go through the dependency hell manually
T33 10390 Paulita: i am talking about watching you idiot
T33 10390 Josef: I prefer Google Video tho
T34 10392 Gale: yeah, the advantage is not having it
T33 10417 Paulita: !seen Quiznos
T30 10424 Margene: I call it dependency heaven
T34 10429 Josef: German, Windows has Crysis, end of argument :P
T33 10433 Paulita: hi pingfloyd
T34 10437 Jeanice: plus, the advantage of laughing at all those who get sucked into its vortex of evil
T35 10437 Hildegard: Josef: yo.
T33 10442 Angla: Paulita, youtube is a video HOSTING outfit. and you can just stop calling people idiots. especially those of a higher intellectual calibre than yourself
T35 10443 Josef: Hildegard, hi
T30 10450 Margene: haha, Crysis will bomb
T30 10454 Margene: bunch of hype
T35 10462 Josef: I bet otherwise
T35 10469 Josef: I'd put money on it but I don't think that's very freenode :P
T34 10469 Gale: German: ok, but each installation is like one more foot in the grave for it due to the dumbest thing every created -- the registry
T33 10485 Paulita: well if your defending idiots Angla, then your one too.
T33 10490 Paulita: now leave me be
T30 10492 Margene: well ok, gamer nerds always trend up on everything, but it's hype, so is directx10
T35 10494 Josef: Hildegard, it was you who brought the OpenOffice issue to my attention wasn't it?
T35 10508 Hildegard: which issue would that be?
T30 10514 Josef: Margene, tbh DX10 is a big improvement, I'm not the trending type
T35 10516 Hildegard: licensing and sale of?
T35 10517 Josef: Hildegard, the ebay thing?
T35 10520 Josef: yup
T34 10531 German: Gale, excuse my ignorance, but doesn't gnome have something similar?(never went into the details of it, but gconf looks like the registery)
T30 10532 Margene: yes, it's a bigger hype than usual
T33 10535 Paulita: all i did was make a brief statement and now i am suffering with all this grief :D
T35 10540 Josef: someone else I know put together an email to send them which I helped him with, not sure if he's sent it
T35 10549 Josef: gonna go over the legal side with a fine tooth comb tomorrow probably
T35 10551 Hildegard: Josef: what did you come up with?
T33 10554 Arlie: Paulita, happens to me all the time ;)
T33 10565 Paulita: hi Arlie
T33 10569 Arlie: Paulita, they love killing the messenger
T34 10571 Gale: German: I don't know all the details of gnome, but those are just text files that gconf uses
T33 10577 Paulita: haha
T35 10592 Josef: Hildegard, they're violating the terms of the license and are therefore illegally selling copyrighted material on ebay. should get the account closed, would be nice to see some refunds but I doubt ebay does that.
T34 10612 German: Gale, my own preference is each program having it's own .(name) directory in $home
T34 10615 Gale: German: more or less the whole gconf gui registry looking thing in gnome is really just a fancy front end for editing them
T34 10619 Gale: afaik
T36 10619 Angla: http://www.grc.com/stm/shootthemessenger.htm
T33 10634 Arlie: Paulita, but having just read the scrollback, you are being somewhat of a snot nosed punk
T33 10641 Paulita: Arlie you want to see my home town? it is on youtube :)
T35 10650 Hildegard: Josef: :D
T33 10651 Paulita: well fine then
T33 10651 Arlie: nope ... dont care at all
T33 10655 Paulita: good
T33 10659 Paulita: cause now i know you too
T35 10659 Hildegard: shutting down a powerseller, awesomeness.
T34 10660 German: Gale, okay but i do have a question here: don't windows ever update their libc? I heard that's what breaks most of the binary compatibility in linux
T33 10677 Arlie: Paulita, im sure it looks exactly like my home town
T37 10692 Christiana: Anybody know a good OS for laptop? Has to support wifi - Office programs and firefox, i thought puppy linux or something.
T33 10714 Paulita: there is a major difference between a monkey hole and a bahia brazil ;)
T37 10722 Priscila: Christiana: why bother asking here?
T34 10729 Gale: German: windows has all sorts of problems with it's system libraries all the time
T37 10729 Priscila: Or do you mean distro?
T37 10734 Christiana: yeah a distro
T37 10741 Christiana: for laptop
T33 10745 Arlie: yeah ... not too many glue sniffing street kids around here ... they all smoke weed
T37 10752 Kit: Christiana: Check "linuxonlaptops"
T37 10764 Christiana: ok tnx
T37 10764 Margene: they drink beer here
T37 10769 Priscila: Christiana: is it a low spec laptop?
T37 10773 Margene: and I shoot em for sport
T34 10777 German: Gale, I know, I am not here to argue that windows is better, just that there are some nice aspects to it(with horrible consequences, but still)
T37 10818 Christiana: 128 mb ram so low spec yeah
T37 10837 Melda: 128mb is hardly low spec :-p
T37 10849 Priscila: it is if you want to use firefox and Office apps
T37 10870 Melda: goldfish: hardly
T37 10879 Christiana: for me it is low spec, im used to powerfull desktops :P
T37 10905 Melda: Christiana: most "low spec" distributions are garnered for 8MB-32MB w/ 200Mhz or less processors
T37 10910 Angla: 128 millibits is quite low
T37 10920 Margene: tell it to my octo core with 16gb ram
T37 10925 Lynda: test
T37 10927 Christiana: 32 mb ram? they used to make those?
T37 10930 Kit: Melda: No.. Your confusing low with ancient..
T37 10940 Melda: Kit: not at all
T38 10947 German: Christiana, I used to have one with 2MB
T37 10953 Christiana: omg :o
T37 10957 Melda: Christiana: umm... your "standard" windows 95 computer came with 32-48MB RAM
T39 10976 Lynda: hey people why doesnt PHP channel work? it sayz overfloww when i try to type.....
T37 10979 Christiana: i use a 64 bit windows vista with 3 gb ram :P
T37 10982 Kit: Melda: Yeah.. And that's VERY old..
T37 10992 Nicki: my first computer had 4kB of ram, a trs-80. :)
T39 10995 Arlie: Lynda, php is buggy like that
T37 11000 Christiana: 4kb?
T40 11002 Priscila: Arlie: heh.
T37 11006 Christiana: What OS runs on 4 KB ?
T37 11011 Nicki: basic
T37 11014 Nicki: ;)
T39 11018 German: Lynda, you must register on freenode
T39 11019 Lynda: Arlie: thanks... darn i got to fix a stupid problem... :(((
T41 11028 Jeanice: win 95 was 8-16 mb ram wasn't it?
T39 11033 Priscila: Lynda: probably means the channel is full.
T37 11042 Christiana: I never used windows 95, it seems to run like crap
T37 11043 Margene: lose 95 was 32mb
T40 11046 Arlie: 4k was the norm for awhile
T41 11048 German: Jeanice, it sure ran on my 16mb, dunno about 8 though
T39 11054 Lynda: goldfish: so i need to wait until some people leave?
T40 11056 Arlie: my atari 400 only had 16k
T37 11059 Christiana: 4Kilobite, what can you do with that??
T37 11070 Arlie: Christiana, microsoft basic on cassette ran in 4k
T37 11070 Jeanice: Christiana: it should be enough for anyone
T37 11078 Christiana: Play with the BIOS or something?
T39 11080 German: Lynda, you need to register your nick at freenode, then try to join
T37 11081 Margene: I remember lose 98 was pretty fast on 64mb
T37 11090 Arlie: Christiana, what bios ?
T39 11091 Lynda: German: thanks !
T39 11102 Lynda: German: hey how do i recover a lost passworD? :)))
T42 11102 Hildegard: 98 was pretty fast even with 32, come to think of it.
T42 11109 Hildegard: at least until you started adding lots of stuff.
T41 11115 German: Margene, until you actually add some programs like antivirus and firewall...
T37 11122 Jeanice: i never had 98
T37 11124 Christiana: Bios is a blue screen with buttons when i pres F1 when pc boots, it says PASSWORD and BIOS
T39 11125 German: Lynda, no idea
T37 11131 Jeanice: went straight from 95 to *shudder* Me
T41 11136 Margene: German, never had that, not even a firewall
T42 11154 Hildegard: Jeanice: ME was a disaster
T41 11160 German: Margene, oh right:D windows 98 wasn't geared towards the internet
T37 11171 Christiana: Windows ME sucks, ERROR this ERROR that
T41 11172 Margene: I didn't even bother with firewalls until I got an error at startup once
T37 11190 Arlie: screw microsoft ... they suck !
T37 11191 Renate: Christiana, no shit?
T43 11210 Celestina loves hating ms
T37 11219 Christiana: Ya rlly
T41 11223 Margene: I went from 98 crooked.. I mean straight to XP
T43 11233 Rosia loves pointing out that saying "screw microsoft ... they suck !" only makes F/OSS look like communism
T43 11237 Gricelda: W MILAN
T37 11240 Christiana: I went from XP to Ubunto to Vista
T41 11248 Renate: Margene, lol... real people used Win NT
T41 11252 Arlie: Margene, hating MS has nothing to do with F/OSS
T41 11262 German: xp->Fedora->Debian should be enough for everybody
T43 11264 Nicki: Renate: and I like pointing out that you don't seem to know the definition of "communism" :)
T44 11270 Arnoldo agrees with Renate
T41 11275 Margene: Renate, yeah, those imaginary people were weird
T44 11277 Renate: Nicki, doesn't matter.... I said "look like"
T41 11280 Arlie: Margene, my bad
T44 11285 Arlie: Renate, see above
T41 11285 Renate: Margene, hehe
T45 11287 Lynda: THANKS GUYS!! :))
T44 11301 Hildegard: Renate: real people still use NT
T37 11302 Christiana: Anal Butt Monkeys, now playing on the video streamer!
T41 11306 Margene: FOSS is communism comrades!
T41 11318 Margene: bring down this MS capitalist pig!
T44 11319 Renate: Hildegard, eh? you're here?.... and wow, the red letters on my xchat screen look painful
T46 11324 Gale: no NT is for the noobs that think they're not
T41 11326 Arlie: for real
T46 11328 Angla: jackson browne had a hit with running on NT
T43 11329 Jeanice: that's GNU/communism
T41 11330 Arlie: microsoft is another enron
T41 11345 Arlie: they didnt make a real profit the entire time bill gates was getting rich
T37 11350 Christiana: Microsoft is loaded with cash, Respect.
T43 11353 Rosia just started a flamewar! lol
T44 11358 Hildegard: Renate: I'm here for a moment. Going in for an xray in a moment
T44 11369 Renate: Hildegard broke a leg!
T46 11372 Angla: they were going to call it MT until someone noticed the phonetic implications
T37 11377 Arlie: Christiana, thats because the stock they give to employees isnt on the balance sheet
T44 11379 Hildegard: Renate: it's my shoulder, actually.
T44 11380 Renate: those servers are pretty dangerous, eh?
T44 11389 Renate: Hildegard, lemme guess, a blade rack fell on it?
T37 11390 Christiana: Arlie: what stock?
T44 11394 Hildegard: Renate: no.
T37 11401 Arlie: Christiana, right ;)
T44 11405 Hildegard: Renate: I have no clue yet, but it's probably arthritis :/
T41 11406 Margene: NT still sounds close enough to empty, and damn fine description
T37 11417 Christiana: Headmonkey: Stock means Stick So what the pell?!
T44 11420 Renate: Hildegard, hehe, well, see ya then
T44 11420 Hildegard: and NT is still, not widely used, but in use.
T44 11426 Hildegard: see ya
T44 11436 German: Hildegard, let me guess, you caught a biological virus because your ports were open again?!
T41 11436 Margene: NT is XP and Vista
T37 11437 Arlie: Christiana, i can tell you spent some time working for arthur anderson
T41 11440 Margene: it's the NT kernel
T47 11444 Ruthe: question: what could cause linux not to find a dhcp server?
T37 11451 Christiana: Headmonkey: I dont eat bananas.
T44 11456 Renate: Ruthe, the fact that there isn't one?
T37 11467 Arlie: Christiana, you should, they have lots of potassium goodness
T44 11468 Ruthe: Renate, xp computer finds it
T44 11478 Renate: eh? dunno then
T47 11485 Ruthe: it was working this morning, suddenly cant find dhcp
T47 11486 Nicki: Ruthe: not plugged into same network? :)
T37 11486 Christiana: Headmonkey: I eat cardboard boxes because of the fibers.
T47 11498 Ruthe: dkkr, plugged directly to cable modem
T37 11502 Arlie: Christiana, while watching mythbusters ?
T47 11507 Angla: Ruthe, lack of networking. or maybe unplugged cable. or maybe a host of other reasons
T48 11508 Nicki: in the lan part of it?
T37 11515 Christiana: Headmonkey: No whil watching JENSEN
T47 11519 Ruthe: Nicki, yes
T47 11529 Gale: Ruthe: try resetting your cable modem
T47 11538 Angla: or turning it on ...
T37 11542 Arlie: you stare at your speakers ?
T48 11549 Nicki: check the log, should give you a message if serevr not found, versus server found but rejected lease request for some reason
T37 11563 Christiana: Rock On!: http://www.myspace.com/thezimmersband  Talking bout my ge-neration!
T47 11581 Ruthe: Gale, unplugging the cable from the linux box and plugging it to an xp box works
T49 11588 Margene: generations suck
T47 11588 Ruthe: xp cn get online
T47 11646 Angla: Ruthe, so you must have changed something. of course, you'll never know what, if you didn't keep a log of all changes to system config
T49 11655 Margene: some people keep insisting I make a myshittyspace, why?
T37 11667 Christiana: Becuz its cewl
T49 11674 Priscila: Margene: because they are retards.
T49 11685 Margene: well I wouldn't be cool to them, since my pic would be flipping the bird to the cam
T49 11693 German: Margene, because they want to pull you down to their level
T50 11693 Tyra: vncviewer mac: "CConnection: No matching security types" and dies, what can I do to make a vnc connection to a mac? this is from linux or may be from windows
T49 11698 Priscila: They prolly tlk lik dis on d intrnet nd use x-marx 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! alot lik dat
T37 11706 Christiana: If even osama bin laden has a myspace, and u dont ,u rgettin old or unliked.
T47 11711 Ruthe: Angla, pretty sure i havent changed anything, box is in argentina, im the only one who knows any password to it
T47 11724 Ruthe: has just been there serving iax2 till this morning
T49 11739 Margene: I'm not getting old or unliked, well getting old, already unliked
T37 11769 Gale: myspace is something that managed to top AOL in lameness
T47 11779 Angla: Ruthe, sorry ? argentina ? and where are you ? how do you know the router works with xp on the same cable ?
T49 11786 Margene: oh cripes, AOheLL
T49 11798 Priscila: I wish all those elite "hackers" would stop going for multinational corporations, and take down myspace.
T47 11808 Ruthe: Angla, im in florida, i know because im talking to someone who is sitting in front of it
T51 11809 Gia: heh
T49 11821 Margene: and isn't myspace just a big pedophile ring
T52 11824 Lajuana: Priscila: why would they want to attack their breeding grounds?~
T52 11839 Priscila: Lajuana: hackers maybe, not "hackers" !
T53 11843 Paulita: i figured this was the perfect song to accompany the Mexodus to Amerika :D http://youtube.com/watch?v=8_B1BcDFdQY
T47 11877 Angla: Ruthe, we're running out of options here. is the person you are talking to, trustworthy and intelligent ?
T47 11896 Ruthe: Angla, trustworthy, not intelligent
T47 11901 Angla: bingo
T49 11910 Margene: well at least he's not a weasely dumbass
T54 11926 Gale: yeah
T54 11953 Mindy: o.o
T54 11953 Gale: weasely dumbasses are a waste of air
T55 11974 Leota: Hi all, anyone know how to mount a usb disk?
T47 11980 Ruthe: yeah, its a pain, but it doesnt change the fact that plugging the network cable to the box, ifdown ifup the interface
T55 11984 Leota: my new kernel doesn't have /dev/sh*
T47 11987 Ruthe: and the box wont get an ip address
T55 11998 Leota: lsusb shows:  Bus 003 Device 003: ID 08ec:0016 M-Systems Flash Disk Pioneers
T56 12005 Lajuana: Priscila: well, I figure that real hackers are above such things, crackers are going to go after things that won't cause permanent mental scarring, and script kiddies feel comfortable and at home there.
T47 12027 Gale: Ruthe: did you try /etc/init.d/networking restart?
T47 12041 Ruthe: Gale, yes
T56 12052 Margene: script kiddies mostly play with weak botnets ddosing forums
T47 12053 Ruthe: also reboot
T57 12057 Angla: is the *other* end of the cable plugged into the computer ?
T47 12058 Ruthe: just to be on the safe side
T47 12060 Gale: how about try that with stop and then start instead
T58 12083 Tiffaney stab's th pirate
T58 12102 Gertrud: :P
T47 12110 Ruthe: Angla, yes, the person im talking to has plugged the cable to the computer before
T47 12127 Ruthe: so at least Im sure he knows how to do that much
T57 12130 Angla: is there another cable to try ?
T47 12141 Gale: has he plugged in a power cable before though?
T47 12152 Ruthe: there is, but why would that same cable work on a different box?
T58 12156 Albertine is starting to hate his custom kernel
T58 12169 Leota: but i do love kde 3.5.7 :D
T47 12189 Ruthe: Gale, he is reading to me what he sees on the screen, system is on
T47 12193 Angla: Ruthe, trying as many possibilities as possible. it's *bound* to be something simple
T58 12240 Renate: Leota, what's new in it compared to 3.5.6? lol
T47 12276 Gale: Ruthe: did you make sure the network module is loaded?
T58 12281 Leota: Renate: you get custom text colour for kicker, so you can have a black background in kicker with nice white text or whatever colour you want
T58 12295 Renate: oh... meh, guess it's nothing new then
T58 12299 Leota: and lots more... but kicker is the awesome bit
T58 12338 Margene: the kicker is the kicker
T47 12348 Angla: Ruthe, if i were you, i'd make a list of possible reasons why. and then systematically try them out. i wouldn't go assuming anything
T59 12377 Jeanice: you need a custom kernel for kde?
T47 12377 Gale: yeah, it's the assumptions that lead to nowhere
T47 12397 Gale: best thing to do is start with the simple and easy to overlook stuff and work your way up
T59 12397 Leota: Jeanice: no the stock kernel is fine
T59 12418 Leota: Jeanice: i just wanted to add stuff like bootsplash, ubuntu's usplash sucks
T58 12425 Margene: I'll just wait for kde 4
T59 12427 Leota: and i wanted initng
T58 12432 Leota: Margene: long wait then...
T58 12434 Margene: till then I'll stick w/ xfce
T47 12435 Angla: the assumption that linux just decided to not work, is the least likely, by far
T58 12439 Renate: KDE4 is vaporware...
T59 12445 Jeanice: Leota: ah i see, sorry, i thought you made a custom kernel for kde. may i recommend gensplash btw
T58 12463 Margene: indeed it is, but 3.5 just doesn't cut it for me
T58 12463 Santo: Margene: why would you go from XFCE to KDE bloatware?  Unless KDE4 will not be bloatware any longer...
T58 12476 Margene: Santo, not go, but try it out
T58 12481 Santo: ah
T47 12499 Gale: Angla: or like I always say, "
T47 12511 Angla: ?
T58 12512 Margene: the only thing is there's a lot of qt apps that are really great
T47 12513 Gale: When it comes to troubleshooting, educated guesses are good, assumptions aren't
T60 12523 Christina: I have a question.  I need to know the kernel parameter to use to tell an ubuntu install where the CD media is located at over a PXE server.
T61 12537 Delmar: has anyone used  Xcircuit ?  is that an app to draw and to test circiuts if theu work ?
T47 12571 Angla: Gale, a calm methodical approach to narrowing the search space, then you shoot the dog that chewed the cable ...
T58 12588 Margene: for example, kget is pretty much the only download manager I've tried that forces resuming on anything, while others fail
T62 12588 Leota: Jeanice: i tried gensplash so many times and i just gave up
T62 12598 Jeanice: Leota: what went wrong?
T62 12614 Leota: Jeanice: compiling it was the easy bit, messing with the startup scripts was where i got stuck
T47 12614 Gale: yeah, being methodical is a big part
T62 12650 Jeanice: Leota: ah, personally i don't use the progress bars
T58 12711 Renate: I'm not a big fan of kget :-\
T58 12719 Renate: then again, d4x is kinda broken too
T58 12735 Margene: I've tried them all, kget is the only one that gets it done
T62 12742 Leota: Jeanice: well i couldn't get gensplash to compile, i just got errors, and had to install from some deb which completely failed, the error was related to the kernel
T58 12743 Margene: nothing in gtk2 that's for sure
T63 12766 Gertrud: ok i have an ext3 image
T58 12776 Renate: Margene, eh? yea, I haven't found a thing that can compare to flashget/fdm on Windows..
T63 12776 Gertrud: i did not unmount it cleanly
T63 12782 Renate: Gertrud, fsck
T63 12784 Gertrud: is there a way to fsck an image?
T63 12795 Gertrud: it throws an error when i try to fsck the image
T58 12797 Margene: archangle25, flashgot/kget works for me every time
T62 12805 Jeanice: Leota: what distro?
T63 12813 Gertrud: its not a disk turned into an image, its 30gb of /dev/zero turned into an ext3
T58 12818 Angla: downthemall works for me
T58 12831 Renate: Margene, well, I never said it didn't work, I just find it lacking in features
T58 12841 Renate: (scripting)
T58 12884 Margene: well I mean in linux at least, that's the only one that works for me when servers have anti-leech mechanisms
T58 12907 Renate: Margene, hint, if they don't want you to leech, don't leech
T58 12923 Margene: no, the problem is they don't just stop leeching, they stop resuming
T64 12934 Leota: Jeanice: kubuntu
T65 12949 Arlie: posting stuff for download, then placing restrictions on downloading it, is against the communist manifesto of the OSS bowel movement
T58 12956 Margene: I'm sure it's a lot worse to restart a download and suck up even more bandwidth than to resume some multi GB file at 90%
T66 12980 Julietta: can pcap inject packets into a open tcp connection ?
T66 13001 Arlie: pcap injects ethernet packets
T66 13004 Arlie: so yes
T66 13010 Arlie: they can be tcp,udp,ip, whatever
T58 13011 Renate: Margene, wait, if the file is non-resumable how do you resume it? o.O
T64 13022 Jeanice: Leota: http://jeandamiendurand.free.fr/debian/splashutils/ worked fine for me
T58 13026 Margene: Renate, I dunno, it just happens
T58 13041 Renate: magic, zomg! :o.O
T58 13047 Margene: you send it through flashgot to the downloader again, and it automagically resumes
T66 13083 Julietta: Arlie, yeah, but don't tcp connections have state information that prevent direct injection like that ?
T64 13110 Leota: Jeanice: those are the debs i tried, it messed with the entire apt-get install process, it couldn't run the post install process because the ubuntu startup scripts are so different and because the pre-uninstall scripts couldn't also be run the hole thing fell apart
T66 13114 Arlie: Julietta, you can inject garbage if you want
T66 13123 Arlie: Julietta, or you can steal someones connection
T66 13150 Arlie: Julietta, how any 1 particular tcp stack decides to respond to your garabge depends on its implementation
T66 13230 Julietta: i actually neither want to steal the connection nor i want to inject garbage (data that is not getting accepted by a valid implementation)
T67 13231 Elli: Hmm
T67 13233 Celsa: good morning
T68 13236 Gertrud: hey Renate is there some special option to pass fsck to get it to fsck my ext3 image?
T67 13244 Elli: Any idea why 'passwd' would ask for a new password four times?
T67 13255 Priscila: Elli: A hacked version.
T69 13261 Melda: is there a way to get ls -l to print full path in each response?
T66 13265 Arlie: Julietta, do whatever you want ... its an ethernet packet
T70 13266 Leota: Jeanice: i had to replace most of the the startup scripts with just echo boo, the problem seemed to be with the kernel not being detected or something
T69 13273 Melda: so it'll show /home/user/filename.jpg at the end of every single line?
T67 13278 Elli: Priscila, yeah that could be a possbility except I just recompiled it from sources, thinking just that
T69 13282 Melda: vs just showing filename.jpg?
T67 13284 Elli: And still the same behavious
T67 13295 Priscila: Elli: Hmmm. Weird indeed ..
T66 13297 Julietta: Arlie, well, i can't, to actually inject valid packets i would need to modify the sockets state
T70 13297 Jeanice: Leota: strange... and what errors did you get when you tried to compile?
T69 13307 Priscila: Melda: ls -l /home/user/*
T67 13308 Elli: Ya
T67 13360 Priscila: Elli: I assume you can trust where you gott he sources from?
T66 13371 Arlie: Julietta, use libpcap to do whatever you want ... your sending ethernet packets ... send valid tcp or dont ... its up to you
T70 13382 Leota: Jeanice: don't have that info at the moment, this kernel only has the bootsplash patch
T69 13391 Melda: godlfish: anyway to do that recursively? like with ls -alR to show full paths/permissions on every file in a tree?
T70 13427 Jeanice: Leota: fair enough
T69 13428 Priscila: Melda: use find, find /home/user/ -exec ls -l {} +
T67 13433 Elli: Priscila, yeah
T69 13447 Felicia: Melda: alias it in your ~/.bashrc
T67 13455 Elli: Priscila, it might be a PAM module problem actually, hmm
T69 13455 Priscila: Melda: actually. that will just do the same thing.
T69 13461 Melda: goldfish: my actual application is a cleint chmod'd "/" to this user... so I want to change EVERYTHING owned by this user on the system to "root:root" and then just fix his homedir
T70 13462 Leota: Jeanice: bootsplash seemed to be easier to install, i added the bootsplash patch, then used splas bla bla > bootsplash, then extracted my initrd file using cpio and added bootsplash to its top level dir, and then recreated the initrd, that was it, the progress bar didn't matter and it doesn't work, also i made a nice ubuntu theme
T69 13466 Melda: rather than reinstalling another system
T67 13471 Priscila: Elli: Ahhh, I've never used that PAM stuff.
T71 13498 Anya: How do you keep someone confined to their home directory? I'm having someone ssh'ing in for irssi, but I don't want them to access the rest of my system
T69 13498 Melda: so i was going to do an ls and grep out his username and then pull the file-paths from like awk '{ print $9 }' from the ls -l and do a | xargs chown root:root, etc
T69 13500 Priscila: Melda: sounds like you want find...
T67 13501 Felicia: Elli: and Pam? .. hrm .. sounds nice ;-)
T72 13510 Arlie: Julietta, ethernet packets dont care what data you put in them ... so long as you have a valid ethernet header with src and dest MAC addresses
T72 13511 Julietta: Arlie, the point is if you inject data into a open tcp connection, the original application maintaining that connection will recieve a ack for packet it didn't send which will likely result in a broken connection, which means i can't actually inject into a connection, it is NOT up to me
T69 13527 Priscila: Melda: find has -user , to find files owned by user, and then has -exec , for executing command on said files.
T72 13532 Julietta: Arlie, ethernet packets don't but VALID implementations of tcp DO
T72 13561 Arlie: Julietta, of course ... you cant just start pretending to be another application or host, unless you have control over it
T72 13568 Arlie: Julietta, as in, man-in-the-middle
T72 13574 Julietta: yeah
T72 13585 Julietta: well, how would i do that
T72 13589 Julietta: on application level ?
T69 13597 Priscila: Melda: so you could do, find / -user user -exec chown root:root {} + , then just fix his home directory.
T72 13599 Julietta: like grab a handle to another apps socket
T67 13602 Elli: Felicia, heh =P
T69 13609 Priscila: Melda: although, do NOT do that actually.
T69 13618 Priscila: Melda: that will fsck up other things....
T73 13632 Abigail: does anyone know what they are doing with poppassd?
T72 13634 Arlie: Julietta, you can send open file descriptors from 1 app to another using message queues and IPC
T67 13653 Felicia: i smiled or sure ;-)
T67 13659 Felicia: er for*
T74 13676 Paulita: http://youtube.com/watch?v=UEOUWQ1Qm5I
T67 13683 Elli: Felicia, you've got a lively imagination for sure >.<
T72 13684 Arlie: Julietta, you can also have an app connect to a proxy, and have the proxy connect to wherever the app is supposed to, but it doesnt require libpcap
T72 13693 Arlie: pcap is for capturing packets on the wire
T72 13706 Julietta: Arlie, is there any way to have that work without doing any modification to the app i want to grab the socket from ?
T72 13717 Arlie: Julietta, use a proxy
T72 13719 Julietta: well, except the proxy which i am actually coding right now
T67 13738 Felicia: these darned red blood cells and hormones keep acting up on me :-)
T67 13743 Elli: haha
T72 13762 Arlie: Julietta, you can also rewrite packets, i think its a feature of iptables
T72 13796 Arlie: Julietta, you could, in theory, rewrite every outgoing tcp packet to connect to your local proxy instead of where it was going
T72 13803 Arlie: Julietta, using a userspace iptables filter
T72 13842 Julietta: hmm, yeah
T72 13899 Arlie: no thanks required, just send money
T75 13924 Laura: Hello, when I open a file I see a bunch of ^M
T75 13930 Laura: Is that bad in vi ?
T76 13973 Paulita: wow dig this http://youtube.com/watch?v=nayarBrD6mk
T75 13979 Antonietta: Laura: it means it uses dos eol
T75 13985 Laura: how do I remove those?
T75 14008 Laura: i don't think it matters thou, cause It works
T75 14033 Antonietta: Laura: tr -d '\r' < file > newfile
T76 14040 Elli: Hmm, reinstalled PAM, no change..
T75 14075 Gale: Laura: :%s/<ctrl-v then ctrl-m>//g in vim
T77 14084 Madison: Arlie: ey ey ey ey
T75 14134 Laura: Gale: what is %s/
T75 14142 Gale: search and replace
T75 14147 Laura: I am don't use vi usually :/
T75 14148 Gale: but actually
T75 14181 Gale: you probably want the second set of // to be a linefeed instead
T78 14282 Lonnie: hi
T75 14285 Gale: Laura: you could use sed instead of course
T78 14296 Lonnie: how do i determine the graphics card from command prompt
T78 14306 Lonnie: graphics card / ram / cpu speed etc
T75 14328 Laura: Gale: yea, but would like to learn VI though :)
T79 14340 Granville: hello
T75 14372 Gale: Laura: you might also consider vim-gtk until you get proficient with vim
T75 14380 Gale: Laura: it's like the best of both worlds
T80 14396 Angla: ... unless you like emacs in kde
T75 14409 Laura: There is a problem
T75 14415 Laura: I opened a file in VI
T75 14423 Laura: Then I closed the terminal screen... now it says recover
T75 14429 Laura: So I open VI and type :recover
T75 14433 Laura: Then :wq
T75 14442 Laura: Then when I reopen that file it still asks me to recover :s
T75 14459 Laura: so should I just delete the swap?
T81 14472 Felicia: Lonnie: lspci, and install and use hwinfo for more as well as cat /proc/cpuinfo
T75 14473 Gale: Laura: that can happen if say you openned it up again somewhere and edited it but the original occurance was still open
T75 14492 Gale: Laura: I would check it out first
T81 14502 Felicia: Lonnie: lspci | grep VGA  for your video card
T75 14503 Laura: how would I check it out? i closed the terminal screen withought closing vi
T75 14529 Gale: open again with vim
T82 14533 Arlie: Madison, someone was in here earlier asking how to run mac osx on vmware ... i assued them of being you
T82 14548 Madison: wtf?
T82 14549 Madison: no
T75 14551 Laura: E325: ATTENTION
T75 14552 Laura: Found a swap file by the name ".UnrealTournament.ini.swp"
T75 14552 Laura:           owned by: Laura   dated: Wed May 23 17:42:09 2007
T75 14552 Laura:          file name: /usr/local/games/ut/System/UnrealTournament.ini
T81 14563 Felicia: Lonnie: hwinfo --help list short options for quick info .. also use dmidecode for mobo info and dmesg | less
T75 14566 Gale: it's going to say that until you rm it iirc
T82 14571 Arlie: Madison, i thought you were trying to offer an osx virtual host ;)
T75 14571 Gale: rm the swap file
T82 14578 Madison: lol
T75 14579 Laura: okay
T82 14581 Madison: Arlie: naw
T75 14586 Gale: but make sure your main one is good first
T75 14588 Gale: I would
T82 14591 Madison: Arlie: i been working real hard on it the last 2 days
T82 14593 Madison: real hard
T82 14597 Madison: almost done
T82 14632 Felicia: Madison: we take Visa , Mastercard and Cash
T82 14656 Arlie: software is never done ... its only in various states of development, lacking features or having bugs
T75 14656 Laura: Gale: Aha so I opened it and then itopens, now I did %s/ctrlv ctrm
T75 14659 Laura: and saved it
T75 14670 Laura: and all the ^M removed
T75 14672 Laura: :)
T75 14678 Gale: yep
T75 14690 Gale: but I forget the sequence for LFs
